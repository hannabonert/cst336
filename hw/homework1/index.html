                Dynamic Programming is an algorithm design technique. 
                <br />
                <p>It is most commonly used to solve problems that have overlapping
                subproblems. The general strategy is to design a recurrence relating 
                the solution of the problem to the solution of smaller subproblems. 
                As the subproblems are solved, the solutions are recorded in a 
                table so that they each only have to be solved once. The original
                problem is then solved using the solutions to the subproblems
                recorded in the table.</p>
                <p>Dynamic Programming avoids the problem of repeatedly solving subproblems.</p>
                In this context, "programming" means "planning".
