                The coin row problem is another case where dynamic programming
                can be applied.
                <p>The coin row problem: There is a row of coins of varying
                values. The aim is to pick up the coins that together yield the
                maximum amount of money, without picking up two coins that are 
                adjacent to each other in the original row.</p>
                <p>The recurrence realtion is defined as follows: 
                <br />
                F(n) = max{Coins[n] + F[n &#8722; 2], F[n &#8722; 1]} for n > 1,
                <br />
                F(0) = 0, F(1) = Coins[1].
                <br />
                Using dynamic programming, F(n) is calculated for each coin, and
                the value is stored in a table. The solution for the final coin
                is the solution to the original problem.</p>
