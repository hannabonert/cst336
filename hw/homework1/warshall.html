                <p>Warshall's algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute the transitive
                closure of a graph. It loops through each vertex, calculating new
                paths through the current vertex that connect vertices that 
                previously did not have a path connecting them. After all vertices
                have been considered, the transitive closure has been computed.</p>
                Pseudocode:
                <br />
                <code>1 let dist be a |V| Ã— |V| array of minimum distances initialized to (infinity)
                      <br />
                      2 for each edge (u,v)
                      <br />
                      3    dist[u][v] =  w(u,v)  // the weight of the edge (u,v)
                      <br />
                      4 for each vertex v
                      <br />
                      5    dist[v][v] = 0
                      <br />
                      6 for k from 1 to |V|
                      <br />
                      7    for i from 1 to |V|
                      <br />
                      8       for j from 1 to |V|
                      <br />
                      9          if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] 
                      <br />
                      10             dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
                      <br />
                      11         end if</code>
